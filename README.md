# VGAFun

This is a fun little FPGA project I did in the summer of 2017 to play around
with VGA. It was implemented on a Numato MimasV2 and successfully displays a
test pattern, though it didn't get much farther than that because Xilinx ISE was
sent to Earth by demonic soul-eaters to punish humanity for all eternity.
